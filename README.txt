Brief:
A supermarket requires a working checkout. MVP is to scan products and periodically ask for a total price, considering any special offers that apply to the product.

Checklist to follow:
Create a new solution
	Include a class library for the logic | Added
	Include a test library for unit tests (feel free to use whatever test library you are most comfortable with) | Added
Prove you can scan an item at a checkout
Prove you can request the total price
Introduce special offers
	Amend your prior implementation to consider offers on items
Prove you can request the total price inclusive of offers


Thoughts:
In the test document it specifically says "This kata covers just the middleware, do not be concerned with UI or data access." Which is the reason I've chose a console application.
